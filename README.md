# Block Breaker

A simple Arkanoid and Breakout style clone made while learning the basics of Unity 3D

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Unity 3D 4.6.2
```

### Rules of the Game

A set of rules and a basic description of what the game offers.

* The game has five levels excluding the basic menu architecture leading you to the win and lose screens and the start screen
* The player has five lives to finish the game.


## What I learnt while building this game

I learnt the importance of having a menu architecture up and running before we dive into the details of the game as if that is neglected it gets very difficult to make menu architecture later.

I learnt how the collision engine in Unity works and how we can manipulate the sprites and various small things through script to make it work easily.

## Deployment

The game is being built for the web and desktop systems.
